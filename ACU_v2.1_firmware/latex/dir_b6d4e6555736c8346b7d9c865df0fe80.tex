Flex\+CAN Library for Teensy 4

\href{https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/56035-FlexCAN_T4-FlexCAN-for-Teensy-4}{\texttt{https\+://forum.\+pjrc.\+com/threads/56035-\/\+Flex\+CAN\+\_\+\+T4-\/\+Flex\+CAN-\/for-\/\+Teensy-\/4}}

Designed for Teensy 4.\+0, compatibility for Teensy 3.\+x. Based on a redesigned model of IFCT from the ground up.

Your sketch should include the header to use it\+:

{\ttfamily \#include \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Flex\+CAN\+\_\+\+T4.\+h\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}

There are 2 types of template constructors available. CAN2.\+0 and CANFD use a different constructor.

To use CAN2.\+0 mode, use\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{FlexCAN\_T4<CAN3,\ RX\_SIZE\_256,\ TX\_SIZE\_16>\ myCan;}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Where on Teensy4, CAN1,CAN2, and CAN3 are available. On Teensy 3.\+x, CAN0 is available on all, but CAN1 exists only on Teensy 3.\+6. The name of my\+Can can be anything of your choice.

To use CANFD mode, use\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{FlexCAN\_T4FD<CAN3,\ RX\_SIZE\_256,\ TX\_SIZE\_16>\ myFD;}

\end{DoxyCode}


Where, on Teensy 4.\+0, only CAN3 supports FD. Teensy3.\+x does not have an FD controller at all. Again, the name of my\+FD can be anything of your choice.

Before using any of the commands of the library, my\+Can.\+begin() must absolutely be called, at a bare minimum to set up the clock and controller. Skipping this first step will hard fault teensy if the registers are not configured.

There are 2 different configurations for baudrates between CAN2.\+0 and CANFD. To set baudrate in CAN2.\+0 mode, you need to call\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.setBaudRate(1000000);}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Where 1000000 is the bitrate of your choice.

To set baudrate in CANFD mode, you need to call\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{CANFD\_timings\_t\ config;}
\DoxyCodeLine{config.clock\ =\ CLK\_24MHz;}
\DoxyCodeLine{config.baudrate\ =\ 1000000;}
\DoxyCodeLine{config.baudrateFD\ =\ 2000000;}
\DoxyCodeLine{config.propdelay\ =\ 190;}
\DoxyCodeLine{config.bus\_length\ =\ 1;}
\DoxyCodeLine{config.sample\ =\ 70;}
\DoxyCodeLine{FD.setBaudRate(config);}

\end{DoxyCode}


There are 2 different message structures for CAN2.\+0 and CANFD.

CANFD\+: {\ttfamily \doxylink{structCANFD__message__t}{CANFD\+\_\+message\+\_\+t}}

CAN2.\+0\+: {\ttfamily \doxylink{structCAN__message__t}{CAN\+\_\+message\+\_\+t}}

Both are very similar, except CANFD structure has a 64 byte payload, edl, and brs switching.

brs by default is set to 1, unless changed in the message structure. This bit, when set, allows the higher bitrate for data to be used in CANFD mode, otherwise nominal rate is used.

edl by default is set to 1, unless changed in the message structure. This bit, when set, allows CANFD frames to be sent, otherwise, sends as a CAN2.\+0 frame, with a truncated payload to max 8 bytes.

Callbacks for interrupts can be used, both for individual mailboxes, or for all mailboxes.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.onReceive(MB0,\ canSniff);\ //\ allows\ mailbox\ 0\ messages\ to\ be\ received\ in\ the\ supplied\ callback.}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.onReceive(MB1,\ canSniff);\ //\ allows\ mailbox\ 1\ messages\ to\ be\ received\ in\ the\ supplied\ callback.}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.onReceive(canSniff);\ //\ allows\ all\ FIFO/message\ box\ messages\ to\ be\ received\ in\ the\ supplied\ callback.}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.onReceive(FIFO,\ canSniff);\ //\ allows\ FIFO\ messages\ to\ be\ received\ in\ the\ supplied\ callback.}

\end{DoxyCode}


Note that there is no FIFO support in CANFD for Teensy 4.\+0. FIFO is only supported in CAN2.\+0 mode on Teensy 3.\+x and Teensy 4.\+0

To enable FIFO support in CAN2.\+0 mode, simply run my\+CAN.\+enable\+FIFO();

Each mailbox can be interrupt enabled or all at once. This allows frames to be interrupt driven rather than polling them in the loop. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.enableMBInterrupts();\ //\ enables\ all\ mailboxes\ to\ be\ interrupt\ enabled}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.enableMBInterrupt(MB4);\ //\ enables\ mailbox\ 4\ to\ be\ interrupt\ enabled}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.enableMBInterrupt(FIFO);\ //\ enables\ FIFO\ to\ be\ interrupt\ enabled}

\end{DoxyCode}


A general callback printout for CAN2.\+0 and CANFD is the following (remove the FD from CANFD for the message structure if using CAN2.\+0 mode)\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{void\ canSniff(const\ CANFD\_message\_t\ \&msg)\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ Serial.print("{}MB\ "{});\ Serial.print(msg.mb);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ Serial.print("{}\ \ OVERRUN:\ "{});\ Serial.print(msg.flags.overrun);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ Serial.print("{}\ \ LEN:\ "{});\ Serial.print(msg.len);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ Serial.print("{}\ EXT:\ "{});\ Serial.print(msg.flags.extended);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ Serial.print("{}\ TS:\ "{});\ Serial.print(msg.timestamp);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ Serial.print("{}\ ID:\ "{});\ Serial.print(msg.id,\ HEX);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ Serial.print("{}\ Buffer:\ "{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ for\ (\ uint8\_t\ i\ =\ 0;\ i\ <\ msg.len;\ i++\ )\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ Serial.print(msg.buf[i],\ HEX);\ Serial.print("{}\ "{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \}\ Serial.println();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


To get an idea of a default initialization of the mailboxes, you may run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.mailboxStatus();}

\end{DoxyCode}
 It will show you how many standard, extended, transmit mailboxes you have, and if fifo is enabled or not.

There is a complex filtering system in the FIFO region, which is not very user friendly. If you have FIFO enabled, running mailbox\+Status will show you how many filters that you can set for it. The library fully automates the masking capability in both hardware and software, taking the struggle away from the users. Usually, when you are setting filters, your first step would be to block all data first before setting the filters. To do this, you would need to use\+:

For FIFO\+: {\ttfamily my\+Can.\+set\+FIFOFilter(\+REJECT\+\_\+\+ALL);}

For mailboxes\+: {\ttfamily my\+Can.\+set\+MBFilter(\+REJECT\+\_\+\+ALL);}

Once this is done, you may configure your filters to allow a specific ID, a group (up to 5 IDs), or even a range of IDs. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.setFIFOFilter(0,\ 0x123,\ STD);\ //\ Set\ filter0\ to\ allow\ STANDARD\ CAN\ ID\ 0x123\ to\ be\ collected\ by\ FIFO.\ }
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.setFIFOFilter(1,\ 0x456,\ EXT);\ //\ Set\ filter1\ to\ allow\ EXTENDED\ CAN\ ID\ 0x456\ to\ be\ collected\ by\ FIFO.\ }
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.setMBFilter(MB6,\ 0x123);\ //\ Set\ mailbox\ 6\ to\ allow\ CAN\ ID\ 0x123\ to\ be\ collected.\ }

\end{DoxyCode}
 For the mailbox, there is no extended or standard selection. Those bits are set on the mailbox and referred to when applying the filter. To see what type of mailbox you have, {\ttfamily run mailbox\+Status();}. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.setMBFilterRange(MB7,\ 0x1,\ 0x9);\ //\ Mailbox\ will\ attept\ to\ receive\ only\ frames\ 0x1\ to\ 0x5.}

\end{DoxyCode}
 (0x1,0x2,0x3,0x4,0x5, and other frames may bleed-\/thru, see enhance\+Filter for sub-\/filtering)\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Enhanced filtering}{Enhanced filtering}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1}
Enhanced filtering is a feature of the library that can stop bleed-\/thru frames from a multi-\/\+ID filter to store messages of IDs that were not requested to the queue. Lets say for example you want a mailbox to store IDs 0x1 and 0x5\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.setMBFilter(MB6,\ 0x1,\ 0x5);}

\end{DoxyCode}
 You will notice that not only frames 0x1 and 0x5 are received, but also 0x3 and 0x7. This is because the 2 out of 3 bits are different between both IDs. Once you enable\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.enhanceFilter(MB6);}

\end{DoxyCode}
 The library will toss out those frames and keep only the ones you requested. So while the hardware does most of the filtering, the library is the final filtering system which allows what you actually wanted to be saved. This can be applied to all FIFO filters as well. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.enhanceFilter(FIFO);}

\end{DoxyCode}


Distribution, on all controllers, the first mailbox/\+FIFO to receive a frame is a first come, first serve, and if you have other mailboxes capturing the same type of frame, especially with individual callbacks, not all will fire, but only one. Distribution overcomes this limitation by copying the frame to the queue if it matches another mailbox filter, allowing all similar filters to receive the same message. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.distribute();\ //\ Enable\ distribution}

\end{DoxyCode}


The mailbox type can be changed to extended, standard, or transmit, using the set\+MB() function. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.setMB(MB9,TX);\ //\ Set\ mailbox\ as\ transmit}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.setMB(MB10,RX,EXT);\ //\ Set\ mailbox\ as\ receiving\ extended\ frames.}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.setMB(MB11,RX,STD);\ //\ Set\ mailbox\ as\ receiving\ standard\ frames.}

\end{DoxyCode}


Events must be used in the \doxylink{src_2main_8cpp_afe461d27b9c48d5921c00d521181f12f}{loop()}, Interval\+Timer, or teensy\+Threads, for the callback system to push received interrupt frames from the queue to the callback. Sequential frames are pushed out from there as well, we\textquotesingle{}ll talk about that soon. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.events();}

\end{DoxyCode}


Sequential frames, if you want to send ordered frames out without bus arbitration making them go out in any order, the library supports sending your frames out from a queue to the absolute first transmit mailbox only. To enable sequential support, set your message structure to msg.\+seq = 1, then write it as normal, the library will only queue it for next cycle if the mailbox isn\textquotesingle{}t available.

The recommended pins on the teensy cards for CAN are used by default. If you wish to switch to alternate pins, you can use {\ttfamily my\+Can.\+set\+RX(\+ALT);} or {\ttfamily my\+CAN.\+set\+TX(\+ALT)} as needed.

Polling frames is possible and won\textquotesingle{}t touch interrupt driven mailboxes. You may use your correct message structure (\doxylink{structCAN__message__t}{CAN\+\_\+message\+\_\+t} or \doxylink{structCANFD__message__t}{CANFD\+\_\+message\+\_\+t}), and simply call\+: {\ttfamily my\+Can.\+read(my\+Frame);} If FIFO is enabled, each read() call will read from FIFO or Mailbox randomly, provided they are not interrupt driven.

There are 2 functions to write messages to the bus\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.write(myFrame);\ //\ Write\ to\ any\ available\ transmit\ mailbox,\ Note,\ sequential\ frames\ must\ use\ this\ function\ only.}
\DoxyCodeLine{myCan.write(MB15,\ myFrame);\ //\ Write\ to\ mailbox\ 15\ (provided\ it's\ a\ transmit\ mailbox)}

\end{DoxyCode}
 FIFO does NOT transmit, only mailboxes do.

In the background, the library has 3 weak functions used for interrupt driven frames, that can be used by other libraries to gather data for their own functionality. An example of this is Teensy\+CAN, which uses one of the 3 weak functions, leaving 2 available for other libraries, if needed.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{extern\ void\ ext\_outputFD1(const\ CANFD\_message\_t\ \&msg);\ //\ Interrupt\ data\ output,\ not\ filtered,\ for\ external\ libraries,\ FD}
\DoxyCodeLine{extern\ void\ ext\_outputFD2(const\ CANFD\_message\_t\ \&msg);}
\DoxyCodeLine{extern\ void\ ext\_outputFD3(const\ CANFD\_message\_t\ \&msg);\ //\ TeensyCAN\ uses\ this\ one.}
\DoxyCodeLine{extern\ void\ ext\_output1(const\ CAN\_message\_t\ \&msg);\ //\ Interrupt\ data\ output,\ not\ filtered,\ for\ external\ libraries,\ CAN2.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{extern\ void\ ext\_output2(const\ CAN\_message\_t\ \&msg);}
\DoxyCodeLine{extern\ void\ ext\_output3(const\ CAN\_message\_t\ \&msg);\ //\ TeensyCAN\ uses\ this\ one.}

\end{DoxyCode}


On Teensy 4, you have actually 64 mailboxes in CAN2.\+0 mode, but in CANFD mode, depending on the data size, can be much less. When setting the region support of the mailbox for FD mode (set\+Region(x)), the function returns the count of mailboxes available to the user. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myFD.setRegion(8)\ //\ default,\ returns\ a\ value\ of\ 64\ (mailboxes),\ each\ one\ supporting\ 8\ bytes\ payload}
\DoxyCodeLine{myFD.setRegion(64)\ //\ returns\ a\ value\ of\ 14\ (mailboxes),\ each\ one\ supporting\ 64\ bytes\ payload}

\end{DoxyCode}
 In CAN2.\+0 mode, set\+Region doesn\textquotesingle{}t exist, you have 64 mailboxes on Teensy 4.\+0, and 16 on Teensy 3.\+x.
